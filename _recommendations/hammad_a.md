Tarek is one of the most creative people that I worked with in my career and that is not necessarily his forte. His ability to mold technology in order to build solutions that solve real world problems is uncanny. A unique combination of dedication, passion and intelligence makes him a rare commodity in the generic technology-buzz ridden leaders market that we find ourselves dwelling in these days. He is rare gem that I have seen grow from raw to seasoned in record time and he will always have a place in my organization, not that I think he will ever need to look for a job.
