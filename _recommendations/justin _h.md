Tarek is a driver of change. Coming into our group from a different industry and customer base he very quickly helped us move our development pipeline and vision ahead. He really did a great job focusing on leading transformation with a view towards making a real difference in how our customers interacted with us and viewed their relationship with us. I am thankful for his drive, his vision and his pushing our development, testing and UX teams to drive quickly towards a goal. If you looking for an instrument of change with an acceptance of new tools, services and capabilities you would do very well with Tarek.
