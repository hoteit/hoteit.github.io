I had the pleasure of teaming with Tarek for the past 4 years to improve the ordering of our products. I found Tarek to be an innovative leader with a very strong work ethic. His ambitious, goal oriented and detail oriented approach as a manager was evident through his ability to analyze, summarize ideas, and enact the right solution for the business. If you are looking for a strong IT professional, Tarek will not disappoint
