Tarek is one of the finest technology leaders I have worked with. His passion for technology is contagious(in a good way).It was Tarek's vision that led to the transformation of a legacy application to a state of the art and modern web portal. Also, it was his leadership and customer centric vision that helped our product to take a leap into the world of mobile platforms. Tarek's "Customer First" approach was key to fixing many long term pestering bugs and thereby enhancing business value of the product
Tarek is a fantastic mentor and has an aura of energy around him when he is discussing technology with his peers.He is and will continue to be an asset for the organization that he is part of.
