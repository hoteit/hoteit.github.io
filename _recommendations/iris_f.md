Tarek was my manager from 2011 to 2013 when I worked at Verizon.
He is one of those rare managers who also naturally serves as an inspiring mentor for the whole team, and exhibits strong interpersonal skills and a unique capacity for empathy. These qualities most notably translate in his ability to motivate a team to care about its project and be invested in the project’s success. Tarek is the go-to person for conflict resolution and problem solving; he steps in to diffuse tension and induce compromising. Though he’s never one to draw attention to himself, Tarek´s positive attitude and the respect others feel toward him are palpable.
I heartily recommend Tarek and would be only too happy to work with him again.
