I have worked very closely with Tarek. It was a great loss to have him leave to the US, but his potential and hunger for knowledge could only be satisfied in the US. I could rely on his for any technical task, as difficult as it could be, he always found a solution, and not any solution, but a smart and out of the box one. His lovely personality, just made work fun with him.

I highly recommend Tarek, he is a great asset.
