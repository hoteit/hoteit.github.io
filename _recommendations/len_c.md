I had the privilege of working with Tarek at Verizon as my immediate Manager for about 4 years.. He was very successful in improving our Operations team tremendously by innovating creative processes to satisfy our customers' demands and also the business. His influence even extended beyond our team as he was always willing and ready to take ownership of problems and assist in resolving them. He is a very innovative and resourceful leader. Tarek is very influential, detail-oriented and attentive to details and these attributes coupled with his educational and professional background, makes him a very effective manager that always produces positive results while creating the best solutions for the business.

"Wherever the fire is hot..Tarek is there" I recommend Tarek.
