Sometime between ‘91 and ‘92 I accidentally saw Pink Floyd Another Brick in the Wall part 2 video on MTV - the scene where school kids turn into ..   Loved the song, so I went and bought a cassette with only The  Wall Part 1 album. Never thought to buy Part 2 at that time. I would then just forward the tape to Another Brick in the Wall part 2 right when the helicopter sound comes up. I stayed doing that for months until one day I thought of playing the whole tape from part 1. I loved it! Right then I went down to the local music store and bought part 2 of The Wall. For some time my world of Pink Floyd was only around The Wall. Never knew anything else existed until I encountered Wish You Were Here on the radio.

But I did not know that Wish You Were Here was for Pink Floyd. I went to music store and tried to imitate the song in case the owner could recall which band was it. When the owner said it’s Pink Floyd and handed me the Wish You Were Here album, the whole world of music changed for me ever since. The Final Cut came next for me, and later Roger Waters Amused to Death. But my love for Pink Floyd took a more obsession when I started listening to Unmagumma, Saucerful of Secrets, Animals, Pipers at the Gate of Dawn, Meddle, and, my best one of all, Atom Heart Mother. Darkside of the Moon was nice, don’t get me wrong, but it was Atom Heart Mother that I had loved the most. I was told that the last album for Pink Floyd was the 1984 Final Cut and I assumed the band was over. I was so wrong.

Two years later, sometime in 1994, the song Keep Talking comes up on the radio. I thought to myself the sound is like Pink Floyd so what if Pink Floyd is back? Surely so! Pink Floyd released the Division Bell. I rushed to the music store, this time the store in Hamra Street. The owner said the shipment of album CDs is on its way shortly, so I parked my car next to the store and waited in the car for a couple of hours.  Waiting for it was so worth it. Sometime after the Division Bell came the Pulse live album. Not my favorite compared to Atom Heart Mother and The Division Bell, but it was Pink Floyd!!

The music of Pink Floyd is so beautiful. The guitars, drums, the piano, the voices, the synthesizers, the words, the album covers, the movie, and more.  No offense to David Gilmour or Roger Waters solo careers, the preWall era with the team as a whole is the best. I thank Nick Mason for putting the Saucerful of Secrets concert. Even though it is not the Pink Floyd band, but his passion and drum talent is Pink Floyd. His concert Saucerful of Secrets is a Pink Floyd concert to me, and Pink Floyd is Pink Floyd forever!
Now off to see Nick Mason Saucerful of Secrets concert here in Dallas !
