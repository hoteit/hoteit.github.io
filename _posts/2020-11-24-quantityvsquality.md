Quality vs quantity is always a heated discussion in product development. Which one should be the best outcome? The story below of a ceramics teacher, taken from the book ["Art & Fear" by David Bayles & Ted Orland](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042JSQLU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0042JSQLU&linkCode=as2&tag=joelfran-20&linkId=IAYMK5OLKHYO4T3S) (cited in a [blog post Notes on the book "Art & Fear"](https://joel.franusic.com/2015/02/27/notes-on-art-and-fear/)) argues that quantity leads to learning from mistakes which leads to results while quality seeks an endless aim for perfection with no end in sight.
