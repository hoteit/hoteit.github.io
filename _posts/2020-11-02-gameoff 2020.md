GitHub is sponsoring a build-your-own game jam for the month of November. The Game Off theme for 2020 is Moonshot. It should be a fun experience if you have the time and the willingness to try even if you are not a game developer. There is one paragraph at the site that excited me:

>Do you really like retro games? Maybe you canâ€¦
>Hack on a Roguelike dungeon crawler in [JavaScript](https://github.com/ondras/rot.js) or [Haskell](https://github.com/LambdaHack/LambdaHack).
>Crank out a text adventure in or some interactive fiction with [Clojure](https://github.com/facundoolano/advenjure) or [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) (similar to Markdown).
>Craft that 8-bit console game you always fantasized about with [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), [Pixel Vision 8](https://pixelvision8.itch.io/), [TIC-80](https://tic.computer/) (Lua), [BASIC8](https://paladin-t.github.io/b8/) (Basic), or [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) (Python).

I will probably try it myself with an 8-bit retro game in Python - will see :)
