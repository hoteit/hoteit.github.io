Same time [12 years ago PC Magazine stopped its print edition](https://www.technologizer.com/2008/11/19/pc-magazine-a-magazine-no-more/). Tech magazines were as important as the computers during the evolution of personal computing. Other well known magazines that many computing enthusiasts would recall and which stopped their printing or completely shutdown include: [Popular Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Electronics) (1954-1985), [Creative Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Computing_(magazine)) (1974-1985), [Byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)) (1975-1998), [InfoWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfoWorld) (1978-2007), [Compute!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute!) (1979-1994), [80/Microcomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80_Micro) (1980-1988), [Dr Dobbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Dobb%27s_Journal) (1976-2009), [Boardwatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boardwatch) (1987-2001), [Antic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antic_(magazine)) (1982-1990), [Compute!'s Gazette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compute!%27s_Gazette) (1983-1995), [Computer and Video Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_and_Video_Games) (1981, 2004), [Commodore User](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_User) (1983-1990), and [PC World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World) (1983-2003).
