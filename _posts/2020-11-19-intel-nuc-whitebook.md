Intel Corporation just launched a new whitebook laptop called NUC M15. Such laptop is expected to be a building block for partners to roll out Intel-based laptops. I believe that all the recent hardware events on large scale, Nvidia purchasing ARM and Apple rolling out M1, and, at a much smaller scale, Raspberry PI rolling out their 400 desktop, are all great initiatives that bring benefits to consumers at all levels.
