Check out the comprehensive bibliography on personal computers by Roy Allan on [archive site](https://archive.org/details/ABibliographyOfThePersonalComputer). Published in 2005, it references over 280 books and 250 periodicals related to the history of computers. The most comprehensive that I know of.
