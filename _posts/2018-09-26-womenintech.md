Cheers to Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer, Grace Hopper, who pioneered computer programming with COBOL, and all the women in tech who run code, projects, teams, and companies. But cheers is not enough. We need more diversity and inclusion in the computing workforce. According to ncwt.org only 26% of computing workforce in 2017 were women, less than 5% were Asian, 3% were African American, and 1% were Hispanic. Only 17% of the 3.5 million computer-related job openings in 2026 will be filled by US computing bachelor students. Those numbers are
not great today but it is worrisome if they stay that way. I participated last year in a career fair at a nearby middle school next to my home in Dallas metroplex and noticed over 50% of the participants who attended my session about technology were girls. Many of them said they are curious into how computer works. Perfect answer! Curiosity for the techie is key! #GHC2018 is a great place for women in technology and for dads like me to encourage their daughters into the field. I will be helping our Thomson Reuters team at Grace Hopper . Always happy to talk about technology.
