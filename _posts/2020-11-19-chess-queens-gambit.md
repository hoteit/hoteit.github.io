Loved the Netflix show [The Queenâ€™s Gambit](https://www.netflix.com/title/80234304). It is about the chess, but it is also about life, health, and competition. Pocket News has a nice collection of reading material to accompany the movie titled [A Chess Reading List for Watching 'The Queen's Gambit'](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-queen-s-gambit-reading-list). It is curated by Alex Dalenberg
