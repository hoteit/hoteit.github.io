If past governments could not turn Lebanon into a non-sectarian non-religious-divided society, mobile services apps such as Uber and Airbnb might do that. Lebanon is divided between Moslem and Christian areas. Peaceful during the most times, but you would sense the awkwardness if you are a person of one religion hanging out or living in the opposite side. You are easily called out by uttering your name or mentioning where you are originally from. The situation does not usually escalate, but it is an uneasy situation to say the least. It has been the case for years, but, nowadays, thanks to apps like Uber and Airbnb, people of any religion can move around or lodge in all areas without such a problem. Such apps do not discriminate, and no app consumer or service provider wants bad publicity online. This is perfect because 1) all Lebanese people need to live happily with their neighbors regardless of sect or religion and 2) service-based mobile apps help boost individualsâ€™ income in ways where Lebanese governments could not do because of the political divisions. When I was recently in Lebanon, I enjoyed Airbnb and Uber wherever we were and felt that we are in new age of unity and prosperity.
