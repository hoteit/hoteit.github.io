There are two types of people. Those who give more than they take, and those who take more than they give. The ratio between give and take can vary from zero to infinity such as zero giving and all taking or no giving but all taking. I think that knowing where you stand in such a formula can make a huge difference in oneâ€™s own life accomplishments and everyday human interactions. Life nurture such as experience can dynamically and actively influence the change in ratio between giving and taking, while life nature, basically age and genetics, can yield an uncontrollable and more slower impact or hardly a change in behavior.  In couple of weeks people will once again plan their new year resolutions. Do consider the giving versus taking ratio formula for the years to come. Hopefully it should be seriously more on the giving rather than the taking side, not 50/50!
