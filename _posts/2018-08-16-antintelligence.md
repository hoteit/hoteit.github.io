“Ant Intelligence” podcast with Dr Deborah Gordon on DataSkeptic is my new favorite podcast episode that I highly recommend for computer and data scientists. Professor Gordon explains how ants are not necessarily intelligent or have a CPU or have decision making tendencies but do make perfect use of frequency rates, rhythm, patterns in behavior that evolved for millions of years and ultimately lead to their complex network and powerful colonies. The ants’ simplicity yet powerful within the biggest complex system of all, Mother Nature, is a perfect example of how artificial intelligent can be very effective without necessarily placing the biggest brains or the most expensive GPUs on it.
