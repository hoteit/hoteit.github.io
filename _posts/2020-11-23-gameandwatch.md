Nintendo is celebrating its 40 year anniversary of Super Mario and 20th anniversary of its original Game and Watch with the latest one [Game & Watch: Super Mario Bros](https://gameandwatch.nintendo.com/). The Game and Watch were so amazing. As a kid, I would carry the two that I had everywhere even to bed. A list of all the games along with photos is on [Wikipedia - LIst of Game & Watch Games](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Game_%26_Watch_games). Esquire has a great article that brings back the childhood memories of the Game and Watch as well - [Enquire - How the Game & Watch Handheld Console Shaped Nintendo for Generations](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a34659956/every-nintendo-game-and-watch-edition-photos/)
