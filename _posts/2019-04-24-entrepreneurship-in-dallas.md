For Dallas Entrepreneurs, soon-to-be, or any of my Dallas contacts, you should check out the following entrepreneurial sources in Dallas. The DEC (Dallas Entrepreneur Center) is nonprofit org to support innovation in Dallas website: <http://thedec.co>. Capital Factory (<https://www.capitalfactory.com/>) brings fellow entrepreneurs, mentors, and investors in one place. You can get a space there to innovate as well. Mavs Gaming (<https://www.mavs.com/mavsgaming/>) is a primary e-sports arena in Dallas. I will write in more detail about these and related key entrepreneurship areas in Dallas, but do check Capital Factory events at <https://www.capitalfactory.com/events/>. I also highly recommend subscribing to Dallas Innovates <https://dallasinnovates.com/>, the newsletter by the [Dallas Regional Chamber](https://www.dallaschamber.org/) and [D Magazine](https://www.dmagazine.com/)
