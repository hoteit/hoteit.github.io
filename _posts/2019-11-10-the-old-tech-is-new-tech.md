My teenage daughter is enjoying listening to her favorite singer on on a 30yr old vintage cassette (tape) playing Walkman. She finds such 20th century technology to be cool. The experience with physical nondigital actions, such as pressing FF (Fast Forward), REW (Rewind), Play, or ejecting then reversing a tape is not just an old school thing anymore. Now, she is asking for a recording option. Similarly, my teenage son loves listening to his latest hip hop albums via a modern LP record player. Turning the disk or switching from one record to another is a cool experience. Both of my kids also bought old vintage instant cameras and are pressing me to find them films. Who said technology need to be solely digital for the future generation?

We need to continuously learn and appreciate the “old” in order to build a better “new”.
