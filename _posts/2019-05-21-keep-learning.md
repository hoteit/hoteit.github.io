These days students graduate and become the new interns/young professionals in the workforce. Energy is high and spirits are up. They want to make a difference. We as long time professionals should embrace that, but they cannot do it alone. We should help them and support them. Don't hire them and just let them stay alone. Work with them and frequently communicate with them. Not once a week but every day of the week! They learn and we learn. We should also learn from our past mistakes and from our past experiences, but we must always learn and help if we are to move ahead and make something new and useful. As Henry Ford once said “anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty”. Keep learning
