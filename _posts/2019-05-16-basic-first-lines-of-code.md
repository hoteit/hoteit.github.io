I will write about Microsoft Build conference soon but one important photo that I feel any developer would appreciate is that of the first lines of assembly code that formed the BASIC language compiler on the first Altair personal computer written by Bill Gates and the late Paul Allen. It can be see at the Microsoft Redmond Campus Museum. Such lines of code sparked the generation of software developers across the world including me.
