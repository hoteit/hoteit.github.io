Software programming languages are predominantly based on the English language. The non-English part is usually some sort of localization of text and numbers. But there has been always attempts to popularize some languages in non-English. Wiki has a list of those: [Non-English-based programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English-based_programming_languages). There are many reasons why such languages cannot be as popular as the English counterparts. For instance, all developers are accustomed to the common programming languages that are all based on Latin character sets and English words. Yet, such efforts are great, regardless, because it would help support the different languages of the world in today's digital era.
