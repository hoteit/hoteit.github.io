A great blog post by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak ["Why the Apple II Didn’t Support Lowercase Letters"](https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/2833/why-the-apple-ii-didnt-support-lowercase-letters) on [vintage computing website](https://www.vintagecomputing.com/). In a question on why the early 70s highly successful Apple II did not support lower case letters, Steve tells a larger story that reveals his ingenuity and his openness to share. Even as being one of the most influential computer innovators in our time, Steve’s words are very honest and transparent, which is a signature computer homebrew hackers mentality that has repeatedly turned passion into innovation regardless of the constraints at the time. Thank you, [Benj Edwards](https://www.benjedwards.com/), for the valuable blog post and an amazing website [vintagecomputing.com](https://www.vintagecomputing.com) that focuses on the history of computing and gaming.
