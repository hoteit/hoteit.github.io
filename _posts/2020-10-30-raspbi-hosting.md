I wanted to support the pioneering movement of Raspberry Pi as a serious edge computing device, so I migrated my personal site [https://www.tarek.computer](https://www.tarek.computer) onto a Raspberry Pi Server hosted at [Mythic Beasts ISP](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/order/rpi). I have the site now running on a Raspberry Pi 4, 4GB, [Raspbian OS](http://www.raspbian.org/), [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/), and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).It is pretty cool to be running a Raspberry Pi server online, and not just leveraging Raspberry PIs as home-based machines for various projects.
