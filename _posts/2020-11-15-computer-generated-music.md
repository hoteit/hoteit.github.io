Listen to the first ever computer-generated music recorded using Turing Machine, the Marc II, by the British computer scientist Christopher Strachey with the help of Alan Turning himself in 1951. The computer filled the entire floor and the music included: God Save the King, Baa, Baa Black Sheep, and Glenn Millerâ€™s swing classic In the Mood. The music that you will hear is the oldest that was ever recorded or publicly accessible, thanks to the BBC and the The British Library. The work was restored by researchers Jack Copeland and Jason Long.
