One essential characteristic in management and leadership is problem solving. It is coming to see IT professionals saying how they solved customer issues or a business problem. But how often do you hear an IT guy or gal saying “I am a handy man and have been relatively successful in solving my own household issues such as electrical or plumbing or hard and heavy work landscaping or fixing anything broken anywhere in the house " small or big”. Not because it is about being cost effective compared to hiring a professional. Instead, it is about analyzing, designing, strategizing, and believing in your self and your guilt feeling. That’s exactly what I was doing these past two weeks with my house and everything around it. Feels good. Sometimes you fail, but you rationalize what has happened and learn from it. Hard work accompanied with continuous learning is a precious asset. It’s worth taking such risk with what you own, because your experience will transcend across every part of your professional and personal life. Make sure to clean after you work, otherwise you will have unforeseen problems in the house!
