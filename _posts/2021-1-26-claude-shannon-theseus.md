In the early 1950s, [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon), the Father of Information Theory, worked at [Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs) and worked in various technologies that ultimately lead to the creation of the digital age. [See Nokia Bell Labs that pays tribute to Claude Shannon](https://www.bell-labs.com/claude-shannon). In the video below, Dr Shannon demonstrated machine learning models by showing an artificial mouse controlled by relay circuits learning its way around a maze. He named it "Theseus". Theseus used trial and error in order to register the right mass in its artificial memory.
