Ish is an iOS (iPhone/iPad) app that emulates a complete x86 Alpine Linux operating system along with a package management tool. Your iOS basically can turn into a complete coding environment such as running Python scripts, using vim/emac editor, and pulling/pushing github code. I personally use it on the go for my coding projects using an iPad mini with an external keyboard case. If you are a developer with an iPad, do check it out at [ish.app](https://ish.app/)
