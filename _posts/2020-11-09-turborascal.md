Dr Leuat, professor of astronomy at the University of Oslo, took the retro computing by storm with his recent release of a complete IDE for 8-bit and 16-bit computing that he named "Turbo Rascal Syntax error, “;” expected but “BEGIN” (or TRSE for short). Unlike other game development editors that focus on single platforms, the TRSE allows you to code, pixelate, and produce games for multiple platforms, including the Commodore 64, Sinclair, TRS80, Amiga, Gameboy, Atari, and more. Note: the word Rascal is related to Pascal :) If you are a game developer or a retro enthusiast, it would be great to check it out. It is impressive that he initially built it for his research, did not publicize it for several years, and suddenly the retro gaming community got a fantastic open-source surprise. You can check his site [Turbo Rascal Syntax error, “;” expected but “BEGIN”](https://lemonspawn.com/turbo-rascal-syntax-error-expected-but-begin). The community is currently supporting its development, and many more games have already started coming out because of TRSE.
