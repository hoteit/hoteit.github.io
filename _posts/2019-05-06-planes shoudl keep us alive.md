All the news about planes crashing, planes burning, planes disappearing, planes stalling, and more of these is so devastating. It is true that one has a higher chance getting into a car accident than a plane crash, but when is this going to stop? When will quality engineering and advanced technologies save more lives? Forget about going to space. We can’t get to air safely all the time. If human generations won’t stop considering every airplane tragedy as a one off incident compared to the total safe flights, what will happen when we have space tourism or space traveling? It will be even worse problems than what human intellect is able to resolve in its lifetime.
