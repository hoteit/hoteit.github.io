Last night I played around with  IBM Watson Internet of Things and Bluemix cloud services platform using their developer tools. IBM changed their developer pricing policy to allow free light accounts not to expire which is a great for unlimited prototyping. I experimented with training Watson conversations dialogues and natural language understanding using their visual aid tool and the github sample codes as part of their machine learning development platform and later ran an IOT simulator using a sample NodeJs app uploaded to their cloud using cloud foundry as part of their IOT development platform. A feature that I liked but didnâ€™t play with it yet was IBM recipes for IoT using NodeRed, a flow based programming tool that was originally created by IBM engineers but is now part of JS Foundation. I plan to a run a real prototype with my Raspberry PIs and Arduinos soon and potentially extend it with Watson as well for an office prototype project.
