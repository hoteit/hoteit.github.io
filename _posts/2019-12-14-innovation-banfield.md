We do a great deal of innovative activities here at Banfield. Like any innovation, some ideas become successful and would scale, while other ideas would get tested but may not necessarily see the light. But, more importantly, the meeting of minds and the energy of trying different things is a strong motivation for success and development. We at Banfield are seriously passionate innovators, drivers, supporters, and motivators that want to make a better world for the pets, for the clients, and for our fellow associates. We are the largest privately-held pet care business in the world, and we strive to be at our best to support all those that we care about. We have a great energetic president who inspires us all to be who we are, what we do, and what we can do. We have a great leadership team that embraces positive change. In my role as the senior director of growth and enablement, I am heading the IT innovation and strategy. Below is the 5 pillars of technology innovation that we put together to help communicate the various technology innovation initiatives at Banfield.

## IT R&D Innovation Lab

The research and development innovation lab is a dedicated team that will be working on various proof of concept projects. The projects that this team will be focusing on is mainly in the artificial intelligence, machine learning, AR/VR, voice, and natural language processing. Specific posts in the future will highlight the work that will come out from the innovation lab.

## CTS Ideas Home Brew PC Club

A shared place and time for Banfield associates to discuss, pitch, and develop their ideas. The club is open for anyone at Banfield, and the meetings are planned once a month for 2 hours at our Central Team Support HQ location in Vancouver, Washington. This is a space for associates to develop their own ideas, pitch it to others for feedback, and possibly work together to brew the idea into the real thing! The club will include special guests from the industry and the technology field, which should also help empower new ideas. The name “home brew pc club”, where PC stands for Pet Care, is a tribute to the home brew Personal Computers club of the 70s that lead to the personal computer revolution. In addition, brewing beer is a huge deal in Portland/Washington, where our Central Team Support (CTS) is located. Hence, the words CTS Idea Home Brew came to exist.

I would like to take the opportunity to recognize the committee members of the home brew club who took from their busy day to day schedule to plan and facilitate the club events.The committee members that we formed to plan and organize the club events are (from left to right)

We kicked off our first home brew event earlier this week. We were honored to have our Banfield president,Brian Garish, kick off the 1st home brew event. Brian highlighted the importance of innovative thinking and how initiatives such as the home brew support our mission in making a better world for our pets. This includes the work by the Banfield Foundation in serving pets and the people that love them. Our CIO, Thiruvallur Srikanth, was there as well, and he always encouraged us all to think through the lens of not just big I innovation but also small i innovation. That means we should ingrain innovation in everything that we do no matter of how big or small the work is.

### Home brew session 1 dec 5  

Brewing ideas like entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs require a start-up thinking mentality, so Asad Butt from KinShip, our Mars-sister company, presented “I have an idea, now what?” to our club members. Kinship is the research and development arm for Mars Pet Care. It manages a start-up investment fund for startups in the field. KinShip experience with how entrepreneurs think and pitch ideas will be a learning experience for our intrapreneurs at Banfield as well.

The first session was, for a large part, an overall planning session for 2020 club activities. We spent the majority of the time capturing thoughts and goals from the members of the club. One cool thing we did is that we actually got a KEG of root beer! Since alcohol should not be served during work hours, we used root beer instead. Otherwise, how can a home brew club exist without some sort of"beer"?

It will be an exciting 2020 for the ideas home brew club!

## Flagship Hospital: Next Gen Experience

Team members experimenting with various ideas would need a real hospital environment to actually test. We plan to take some of the ideas and partner with our business partners to test them at actual hospitals. More to come about this in the near future.

## Business & Societal Partnerships

Not all innovation projects need to be completely developed without business as well as societal partnerships. There are various opportunities that would partner within the industry. Banfield including Banfield Foundation are very active in the community. We plan to expand our technology ecosystem by partnering with educational institutions, organizations, shelters, and sister companies at Mars. Multiple events are already happening on this front and will be shared in future posts.
