I believe that an effective strategy for b2b (business to business) companies to innovate and grow is by powering their talented resources as if they are b2c (business to consumer) clients. Thatâ€™s because the current generation of talents, millennials and post millennials, are digital consumers armed with the power of social networking and digital-everything. If b2b companies makes them feel cool and hype, the products they develop will be cool and hype, and the customers, young or old, could double down on such businesses because such companies are meshing modern and trustworthy professional experience. The only caveat is that b2b companies must have an organic feeling of doing this by seriously perfecting new talent acquisition and more seriously transforming their products and services quickly. Anyway, saying it versus actually doing it is not the same.
