Same time twenty years ago (year 2000) I was at an accountant office during New Yearâ€™s Eve watching over their servers and software to make sure the year 2000 passes with no glitches in their systems. I previously did the software upgrades and carefully checked everything as the year 2000 trickled through the night. Ensuring customer satisfaction and systems availability year after year is and will always be an critical trait in technology leadership. Otherwise what is the value of technology if the experience is broken? Happy new year everyone and all the techies out there.
