Atari, the maker of the original 2600 Video Computer System, is on the roll. They have a [Atari Hotels](https://atarihotels.com/) in the making, [Atari Token](https://www.atarichain.com), a blockchain token system based on Ethereum and bitcoin, a modern gaming system in the works, the [Atari VCS](https://atarivcs.com/), a [virtual casino in the works](https://www.atari.com/atari-casino/), and a whole set of new games. See the [full Atari catalog](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WtRVWOgDyp3a9taKHU4zqIkjYrt5Db2I/view). On a seperate topic, check the Wired article titled ["The Evolution of Game Console Design—and American Gamers"](https://www.wired.com/story/evolution-of-game-console-design-america/)

It also seems that one of the oldest feuds in gaming history is still running - Atari vs Activision but in a good way. Activision was founded in 1979 by former Atari game developers who wanted to independently develop games for the Atari 2600. 20 years later, Atari is reinventing itself in the modern gaming with blockchain-support virtual products and hotels too. On the other hand, Activision, which is now Activision-Blizzard, is currently one of the largest game companies in the industry and carries popular games such as Call of Duty, Diablo, Candy Crush Saga, and others. Now, Atari is pushing to be a strong market player on blockchain for the gaming industry with its public release of Atari Ethereum-based tokens, Atari Token. I think we need to keep an eye on the evolution of blockchain technologies for the gaming world.
