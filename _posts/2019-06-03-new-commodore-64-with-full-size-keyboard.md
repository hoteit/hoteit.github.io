Subsequent geeky announcements canâ€™t get any better these few days. I posted about Raspberry Pi 4.0 release earlier and now a much more exciting news for me at least is the upcoming release of a new Commodore 64 with full size keyboard later this year.

The new full size to be released in Dec 2019 will expand on the c64mini that was recently released and is still fun to play or code with even with its fake miniature keys. (I will blog about that one soon). However, this will full fledged version with the exactly full size keys that shaped our coding and gaming childhood.
