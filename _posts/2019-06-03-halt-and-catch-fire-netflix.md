Been watching “Halt and Catch Fire” on NetFlix for the second time. It spans the history of computers in the 80s and later the Internet in the 90s through a series of fictitious events that closely resemble reality at the time. If you are a geek and bored from watching reruns of War Games or Silicon Valley then this is show is a must. My favorite quote from the show is “computers aren’t the thing. They’re the thing that gets us to the thing. Watch it on Netflix.
