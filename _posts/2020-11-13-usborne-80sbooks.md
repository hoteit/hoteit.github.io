[Usborne Publishing](https://usborne.com/us/) had popular programming books for kids in the eighties. They would help kids learn the basics of computers and how to program games for the Commodore 64, Vic-20, Sinclair Spectrum, and BBC Micro using BASIC programming language. They now made the books free to download as PDF from their site [Usborne 1980s computer books](https://usborne.com/gb/books/computer-and-coding-books). The publishing house still offers new coding books and other topics for kids which is great for our children. Interestingly, an open source community is now helping with converting the source code of such childhood memory books into the modern programming language, Python. Converted books are at GitHub repo: [beeware/yorkshire4](https://github.com/beeware/yorkshire4)
