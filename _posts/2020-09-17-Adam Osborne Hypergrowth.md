A great accidental find! A signed book of "Hypergrowth" by Adam Osborne himself, the founder of the first commercially successful laptop computer, the Osborne 1, in 1981. The book was coauthored by the legendary tech columnist John C Dvorak. I also found a letter signed by the makers of "The Computer show" in the book.
