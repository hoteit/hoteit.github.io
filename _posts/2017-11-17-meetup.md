My friends, Aamer Charania, Babar Bhatti, and I had a meetup on artificial intelligence and deep learning at Thomson Reuters office in Carrolton Texas.
Aamer gave an overview of the group and neural networks. I gave a live demo of supervised, unsupervised, deeplearning, and reinforcement learning using Jupyter notebooks, tensor flow, and Python code from [DanielSlater](https://github.com/DanielSlater/PythonDeepLearningSamples) that I ran on my machine to demonstrate reinforcement learning when playing Atari Breakout or Pong. I also listed important resources on frameworks, models, and getting started material for learning machine learning and deep learning. Babar then walked the audience on different businesses and scenarios for running deep learning. We had a wonderful audience of more than a hundred technology enthusiasts. It was an exciting event that we can't wait to do more of those in 2018!
