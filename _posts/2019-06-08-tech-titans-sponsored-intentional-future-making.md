I attended Tech Titans sponsored"Intentional Future Making" event at UTD. Speakers were [Anne Balsamo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAALU4Ba16OMdCIed1pE5E06_NLx1YTEVw/), Dean of UTD School ATEC, [Gwen Ishmael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAMauwB4ZcCzpnYfkRGE00jXzCVzRmDtIA/), Escalent SVP, and [Ted Farrington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAD0UigBMPl9rcW4pGvgo8vKd1cu1JafsfQ/), Kalypso Fellow. Dr Balsamo discussed the importance of researching culture and human behavior for innovation. Ms Ishmael shared use cases on digital ethnographic research, and how it applies in today's technology consumption. Dr Farrington discussed deductive and inductive scenario methods, and how it was successful at major corporate R&D. Panel followed with questions from audience. I asked about the challenges facing ethnographic & R&D researches that are grounded in solid academic principles, while many startups jump quickly on the next idea and may be impatient for timely R&D. The challenge exists and innovators must realize the importance of timely research before jumping onto their idea. Panelists shared their insight on the criticality of research to prevent failed implementations, but at the same time, researchers are able to adapt to the new business requirements and are providing findings at lesser time while cautioning innovators against the risk of fast findings through incomplete research.
