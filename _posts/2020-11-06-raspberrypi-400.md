In the eighties, we used to having homes computers, such as the Commodore or the BBC Micro, with a keyboard integrated to it. All we had to do is to plug it to the tv, and WHAAAMMM... we are in our our computer world. The Raspberry Pi is reviving the same experience with their new Raspberry Pi 400 computer. The keyboard itself has the built-in computer. Its awesome and cheap especially for home and education use.
