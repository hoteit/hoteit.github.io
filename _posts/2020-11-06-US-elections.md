The US elections, both 2016 and 2020, have demonstrated significant misrepresentations of actual outcomes. The poll predictions were way off. Also, the manager of one county on cnn now was talking about different databases that are not in sync. Why the most technology country in the world that boasts its AI, technology, and scientific excellence does not make its voting process more robust. In 1890, [Herman Hollerith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Hollerith) invented the [tabulating machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabulating_machine) to help process census data using punched cards. It eventually led to the creation of IBM. (Wikipedia photo of a replica 1890 tabulating machine is shown below.) More than a century later, it feels like the technology and the process of statistical accuracy has not really changed in the United States. Possibly because of the political process.
