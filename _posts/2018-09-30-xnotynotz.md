Witnessing over 20,000 women in tech attendees at #GHC18, majority of those by pure observation seem to be in their early twenties, hence Generation Z (those born after 1998), filling all lecture rooms about IT & AI, occupying career fair booths, and consumed with technology, internet, and mobiles phone, are all strong indications that Generation Z is most crucial generation to think of. Whether it is the old or the new generation of businesses, Generation Z is consumers, producers, and employees of technologist today and pretty soon will be employers as well – that’s if they are not there already because they are entrepreneurs as well.

In the last couple of years, we witnessed many companies talking about digital transformation – mobile-first, cloud-first, and everything digital. The era of digital became popular in the last two decades mostly because of the rise of social media and mobile; all thanks to the Generation Y or millennials, those born in the early 80s, who use technology for everything. The enterprises that are trying to transform into digital are run by older generations, the X born from the early-mid 1960s to the early 1980s or the Boomers born before the X. It remains to be seen if digital transformation by enterprises run by Generation X or Boomers at a time when millennials are maturing in the field and the younger Generation Z are not taking over the workplace would force more subsequent business transformations or even bigger bangs! But we need not get carried away with this. What we need is a right amount of customer analytics, market studies with explicit delineation between generations (Boomers, X, Y, & Z) in the researches’ demographics, as well as products and services targeting generation Z consumers.

So if I want to go back to the title of this article, “X is not Y and is surely not Z”, I would ask any of prior-than-generation-Z readers and myself to: “as generations of A to Y” make sure that you think as Z because there is nothing after Z!
