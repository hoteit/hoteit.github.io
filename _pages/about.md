I am a Lebanese American, husband, dad, and IT techie living in Washougal, Washington. I am currently the Senior Director of data and innovation within IT at Banfield Pet Hospital in Vancouver, Washington. Before Banfield, I held various IT leadership positions at Thomson Reuters and Verizon Communications in Dallas, Texas. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the American University of Beirut, a Masters in Business Administration from the University of Dallas, and a Ph.D. in Management and Technology from Walden University. I am also a certified Lean Six Sigma Black Belt. Besides my corporate engagements, I help support the IT community through public speaking, open-source code contributions, and content sharing through social media.

My passion for computers spans over 35 years. It all began sometime around 1981 when I was seven years old and first saw PacMan on Atari 2600. Seeing those moving dots on a black and white television and later in color aroused all the curiosity in me to learn more, play more, and experience more computers and video game electronics. Since that day, I have never turned back on computers.

I will share my thoughts on various technology topics, especially vintage computing and retro gaming, on my website. I hope that you will find something on the site that may interest you. Thanks again for visiting my site.
